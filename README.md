# password-generator

## Description
For this week's challenge I used JavaScript to create a random password generator. This password generator is able to be manipulated by the user by letting them choose to inlude one or more of the following: special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers. The user gets to decide on a number of characters between 8-128. If the user enters a number outside of that parameter or does not choose any of the criteria, they will be alerted of the error and reprompted on the area of error.
